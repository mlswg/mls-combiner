It is also considered consumed and deleted once used\r\n2.

Also, I don't believe MLS implementations will provide public access to the epoch secret or a function to derive secrets from it directly.\r\n\r\nI went ahead and added a note mandating the deletion of `hpqmls_exporter` to ensure we get the desired FS guarantees.",

If we don't provide a combined wire format for `PrivateMessage` and `PublicMessage`, applications will always have to create their own wrappers to distinguish the two.\r\n\r\nI agree that the other wrappers might not be necessary, but the wrappers around these two message types are very useful for applications.",
